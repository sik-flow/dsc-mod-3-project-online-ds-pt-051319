    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand all required aspects of the Final Project for Module 3\n",
    "* Understand all required deliverables\n",
    "* Understand what constitutes a successful project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Another module down--you're half way there!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-3-project/master/halfway-there.gif'>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the culmination of Module 3, you just need to complete the final project!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll be working with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company. You probably remember the Northwind database from our section on Advanced SQL. Here's the schema for the Northwind database:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-3-project/master/Northwind_ERD_updated.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be of value to the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of your project is to query the database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis.  In this statistical analysis, you'll need to perform a hypothesis test (or perhaps several) to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to answering this question with a hypothesis test, you will also need to come up with **_at least 3 other hypotheses to test on your own_**.  These can by anything that you think could be imporant information for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this hypothesis, be sure to specify both the **_null hypothesis_** and the **_alternative hypothesis_** for your question.  You should also specify if this is one-tail or a two-tail test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For online students, there will be four deliverables for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.\n",
    "2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.\n",
    "3. A **_[Blog Post](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging)_**.\n",
    "4. An **_\"Executive Summary\" PowerPoint Presentation_** that explains the hypothesis tests you ran, your findings, and their relevance to company stakeholders.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: On-campus students may have different delivarables, please speak with your instructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.  \n",
    "<br>      \n",
    "* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  \n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "* Any SQL code written to source data should also be included.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Findings_**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your notebook should clearly show how you arrived at your results for each hypothesis test, including how you calculated your p-values.   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* You should also include any other statistics that you find relevant to your analysis, such as effect size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blog Post Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer back to the [Blogging Guidelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging) for the technical requirements and blog ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summary Must-Haves\n",
    "\n",
    "Your presentation should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:\n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "    * A high-level overview of your methodology  \n",
    "    <br>  \n",
    "    * The results of your hypothesis tests  \n",
    "    <br>  \n",
    "    * Any real-world recommendations you would like to make based on your findings (ask yourself--why should the executive team care about what you found? How can your findings help the company?)  \n",
    "    <br>  \n",
    "* Take no more than 5 minutes to present  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "* Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Rubric \n",
    "\n",
    "Online students can find a PDF of the grading rubric for this project [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-3-project/blob/master/module3_project_rubric.pdf). _Note: On-campus students may have different requirements, please speak with your instructor._\n"
